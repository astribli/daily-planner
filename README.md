# Work Day Scheduler 

## Description
Work-scheduler is styled to look like a daily planner with 9AM-5PM timeblocks that are green while they have yet to happen, and red after the time has passed. You can add new tasks in the time blocks and save using the icon to the right. The current date and day of the week is listed near the top of the page.
